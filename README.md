# RuneScape Bot Scripts

This repository contains scripts for automating tasks in RuneScape. These scripts were written for self-learning purposes and are not intended to encourage breaking the RuneScape Terms of Service.

## Scripts

### 1. Battlestaff Script
**File**: `battlestaff_script.py`

This script automates the process of crafting battlestaves by combining elemental orbs with battlestaves.
Note that only the two inventory slots highlighted (refer to image) will be acted upon by script.
Your character will be standing on the tile beside the 2nd banker on the western counter at GE.
### 2. Herb Cleaning Script
**File**: `herb_cleaning.py`

This script automates the process of cleaning grimy herbs in your inventory.
Your character will be standing on the tile beside the 2nd banker on the western counter at GE.
### 3. Woodcutting Yews Script
**File**: `woodcutting_yews_wcguild.py`

This script automates the process of chopping yew trees and banking the logs in the Woodcutting Guild. Note that this script is still a work in progress and only the specific spot documented in the screenshots are supported at the moment.

## Disclaimer

These scripts were created to document my self-learning in scripting and automation. They are not intended for actual use in OSRS and may violate the game's Terms of Service (ToS). Using these scripts in the game can result in a ban or other penalties. I do not encourage the use of these or any other scripts that automate gameplay in RuneScape, Old School Runescape or any other online game.

## Usage

To use these scripts, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install pyautogui opencv-python numpy keyboard pillow
    ```
3. Run the desired script:
    ```sh
    python battlestaff_script.py
    ```

## Learning and Documentation

These scripts are part of my journey to learn Python and automation. Feel free to use them as a reference for your own learning purposes.
